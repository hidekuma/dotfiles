Enter plan mode. Before implementing anything:

1. **Analyze** the request thoroughly
2. **Break down** into discrete steps
3. **Identify** dependencies and risks
4. **Create** a numbered implementation plan
5. **Ask** clarifying questions if needed

Output a clear plan in markdown format. Wait for user approval before proceeding to implementation.

Do NOT write code yet. Plan only.
